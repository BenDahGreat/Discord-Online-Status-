If you even bother to read this, this project was meant for your discord account to have an online state, even when you exit the client.
Also, it is not my fault or concern if your account gets banned for breaking TOS because basically you kinda are breaking TOS by doing this kinda
1. download the zip from github and save them in the downloads folder or somewhere where you can find them I guess.
2. Then go to repl.it then make an account and select "new repl" once its done, then select the language. * IT MUST BE PYTHON IN ORDER TO WORK *
3. copy and upload all the files except the README.md, in the env file, you must paste your account token. How to find your token: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEgFvgg7ZPI
4. once you paste it, head into main.py and edit the status you want for example I put dnd as do not disturb so when I go offline, it shows that status instead of offline, so do you know what I mean?
I've had alot of issues with setting it as idle or online because when I open the client, it wont display as dnd EVEN if I select it so I'm working on that as we speak 
5. Click run, it should install dependencies, then it should ping your account and test it by exiting discord then going on your alt and seeing your status change!
6. (ITS NOT OVER YOUR SHITHEAD) go to uptimerobot.com to make the status stay like that forever and once you made a new account, head over to the main menu. 
7. Click "ADD NEW MONITOR" then select the monitor type to be HTTPS then copy the repl.it link then paste it. Where it says to select 1 of zero, select both check boxes because I mean 
who wouldnt? 
8. After that, uptime robot would ping repl.it  and thus make your accounts NEVER GO OFFLINE thanks to me.
HAVE FUN, and share with your friends!
